=> Application Runner(I) <=

Application Runner is an interface that allows us to run code right after application gets started.
Our class implementes this interface and overrides the run method inside it.
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements ApplicationRunner {
public static void main(String[] args) {
SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
}
@Override
public void run(ApplicationArguments arg0) throws Exception {
System.out.println("Hello World from Application Runner");
}
```
