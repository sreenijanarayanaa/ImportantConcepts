=> application.properties file <=

This file is used to define various configuration settings/properties for a spring boot application
It is located in src/main/resources directory
This allows us to specify different types of properties such as changing the post, database connectivity properties etc

=> Profiles <=
They allows us to seperate parts of application configuration and make it only available in  certain environments
It's like having different settings for our application depending upon the situation.
For ex, we might need one set of settings for dev, one for testing and yet another for production.
It's like having different playlists in our music app- one for working out, one for relaxing etc.
Each playlist sets a different mood just like each profile sets up a different environment.

==> Project code and more info on Spring Profiles available in =========SpringProfiles============ repository
